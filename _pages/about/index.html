<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Hello! I’m Wendi Liang, a soon-to-be graduate with First Class Honors in Mechanical Engineering from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (<a href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk/me/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PolyU</a>), expected in August 2025. Currently, I conducted research under the supervision of <a href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk/me/people/academic-teaching-staff/chu-kar-hang-henry-prof/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Henry Chu</a> at PolyU’s Bio-Robotics Lab. Last Summer, I had the opportunity to work as a research intern at the Active and Interactive Robotics (A.I.R.) Lab under the supervision of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/mechanical-mechatronics-engineering/profile/y526hu" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Yue Hu</a> at the University of Waterloo.</p> <p>My research experience covers various aspects and applications of robotics. Initially, I developed a platform to remotely control a robotic arm using virtual reality (VR) devices. Subsequently, at the Bio-Robotics Lab at PolyU, I applied reinforcement learning methods to continuum robot models. At the Active and Interactive Robotics (A.I.R.) Lab, University of Waterloo, I further explored the application of reinforcement learning in enhancing human-robot interactions.</p> <p>I am actively seeking PhD opportunities starting Fall 2026.</p> </body></html>
